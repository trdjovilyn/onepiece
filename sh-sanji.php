					<header><strong><h3>Sanji (サンジ?) </h3></strong></header>
					<h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
						<p>While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Sanji (サンジ?) stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff (赫足のゼフ Aka-Ashi no Zefu). During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave, but Zeff jumps after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー Ōru Burū), a legendary sea, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaway together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him their entire food, surviving himself by eating his own leg. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style.[ch. 56–59] Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and in fighting only uses his legs, so as to protect the hands he needs to cook.[ch. 48, 370] He also develops an unusual weakness for women, and makes a principle of never harming one, even if it means his death.</p>
					<h5><strong>Middle Life</strong></h5>
						<p>Eventually he becomes infamous under the name of "Black Leg" Sanji (黒脚のサンジ Kuro Ashi no Sanji),[ch. 435] and while training for a period of two years in Emporio Ivankov's Kamabakka Queendom(カマバッカ王国 Kamabakka Ōkoku), develops the Sky Walk (空中歩行 Sukai Wōku), a variant of the Six Powers (六式 Rokushiki) technique Moonwalk (月歩 Geppō), which allows him to essentially run through air.</p>
