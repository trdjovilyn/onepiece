					<header><strong><h3>Nami (ナミ?)</h3></strong></header>
					<h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
						<p>Adopted and raised by Navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Bellemere, Nami (ナミ?) and the older Nojiko, have to witness their mother being murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang occupies their island and extracts tribute from the population. Striking a deal with him, Nami, still a child but already an accomplished cartographer who dreams of drawing a complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to eventually buy freedom for her village. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate, drawing maps for Arlong and stealing treasure from other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket and navigator with an exceptional ability to forecast weather.</p>
					<h5><strong>Middle Life</strong></h5>
						<p>After Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami joins the latter in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar" Nami (泥棒猫のナミ Dorobō Neko no Nami).[ch. 94f., 435] Throughout the series, her weapon of choice is a three-sectioned bō staff, later versions of which allow her to produce various weather phenomena.</p>
