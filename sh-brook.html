					<header><strong><h3>Brook (ブルック Burukku?)</h3></strong></header>
					<h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
						<p>Already a pirate before the time of Roger, "Humming" Brook (ブルック Burukku?) first enters the Grand Line as vice-captain of the music-themed Rumbar Pirates. Leaving their pet, the infant whale Laboon, behind at Reverse Mountain, they promise to return after sailing around the world.[ch. 487] Instead, they are annihilated, with one exception. The power of the Paramecia-type Revive-Revive Fruit (ヨミヨミの実 Yomi Yomi no Mi) allows "Dead Bones" Brook to rise again and live a second life as a skeleton.</p>
					<h5><strong>Middle Life</strong></h5>
						<p>Fifty years later, Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise and to that end joins the Straw Hat Pirates.[ch. 459][citation needed] Brook is an excellent musician, who says that he can play any instrument, although he is usually seen playing the violin.[ch. 486] He can even influence people with his music to the point of making them fall asleep.[ch. 454] While separated from the other Straw Hats, and incognito as "Soul King" Brook, he gains world fame, filling concert halls with fans.[ch. 600] He is also a skilled fencer, who uses a shikomizue (a Japanese cane sword) in battle.[citation needed] His reduced weight allows him to jump extraordinarily high and to run across water.[ch. 443, 493] And eventually, he learns how to use his devil fruit ability to leave his skeleton body and explore his surroundings as a disembodied soul.</p>
