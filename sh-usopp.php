					<header><strong><h3> Usopp (ウソップ Usoppu?)</h3></strong></header>
					<h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
						<p>During his early childhood, Usopp (ウソップ Usoppu?) is abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who leaves to join the Red-Haired Pirates. Then, as Banchina (バンキーナ Bankīna), his mother, falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father would return and take them out to sea. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving, but strives to become a great pirate himself, despite his cowardly disposition.[ch. 25, 41] He is a gifted inventor, painter and sculptor.</p>
					<h5><strong>Middle Life</strong></h5>
						<p>In combat, he primarily relies on slingshots to fire various kinds of ammunition with great precision.[ch. 332] Eventually, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego "Sniper King the King of Snipers" (狙撃の王様そげキング Sogeki no Ō-sama Sogekingu), a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape.</p>
