			<h3>World Map</h3>
			<p class="w_map_detail">It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line, which is also the only continent in the world. The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue , West Blue and South Blue. Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts. Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line. The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is also known as the New World.</p>
