					<header><strong><h3>Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ Monkī Dī Rufi?)</h3></strong></header>
					<h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
						<p>At the age of seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実 Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives his body the properties of rubber. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril and cause Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After that, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks. Instead he resolves to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by Shanks thus spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes sworn brother with Garp's other wardAce, and local runaway noble Sabo.</p>
					<h5><strong>Middle Life</strong></h5>
						<p>Ten years later, and still wearing Shanks' treasured head covering, Luffy forms and captains his own pirate crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for theGrand Line and quickly gains infamy as "Straw Hat" Luffy (麦わらのルフィ Mugiwara no Rufi).[ch. 2, 7, 96, 98] Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Ace from execution, he spends two years on a secluded island, learning the use of the three colors of Haki from Silvers Rayleigh, before heading to the New World.</p>
