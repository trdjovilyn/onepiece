					<header><strong><h3>Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ)</h3></strong></header>
					<h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
						<p>A swordsman who uses up to three swords simultaneously, holding one in each hand and a third in his mouth.[ch. 3, 5, 28] To fulfill a promise to Kuina, his deceased childhood rival, he aims to replace "Hawk Eyes" Mihawk as the world's greatest swordsman.[ch. 5, 50] Traveling the seas in search of Mihawk and making a living as a bounty hunter, he becomes infamously known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro). Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo. To keep harm from innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be temporarily incarcerated, while Helmeppo plots to have him killed.</p>
					<h5><strong>Middle Life</strong></h5>
						<p>Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream Zoro grows fond of his crew and after several defeats in their defense, his priorities change and he convinces Mihawk to take him for a student.</p>
