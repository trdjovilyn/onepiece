					<h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
						<p>Growing up in Ohara (オハラ?), home of the world's oldest and largest library, Nico Robin (ニコ・ロビン Niko Robin) becomes an archaeologist at the age of eight.[ch. 391f.] At some point she gains the power of theParamecia-type Flower-Flower Fruit (ハナハナの実 Hana Hana no Mi), which allows her to have temporary copies of parts of her body, including her eyes and ears, spring up on surfaces near her.[ch. 170] Behind the backs of her teachers, she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called Poneglyph (歴史の本文 Pōnegurifu), which are scattered around the world, and comes to share their goal of finding the illusive Rio Poneglyph (真の歴史の本文 Rio Pōnegurifu), which is said to tell the world's lost history. However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.[ch. 218, 395] Called "Devil Child" (悪魔の子 Akuma no Ko), traumatized and with a bounty on her head, Robin lives a life on the run, unable to trust anyone.</p>
					<h5><strong>Middle Life</strong></h5>
						<p>To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws, until eventually joining forces with Sir Crocodile, leading Baroque Workswith him, under the codename "Ms. All-Sunday" (ミス・オールサンデー Misu Ōrusandē).[ch. 398] After Baroque Works falls apart and without anywhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates and grows so fond of them that she gives herself up to the Government in order to save them. Only after they find out about her motives and declare open war on her powerful nemesis to get her back, does she come to realize that she has finally found people who will never sell her out, and becomes a part of the crew. </p>
